Currently, the fields of data science and machine learning are hot topics.
Consequently, one can find countless articles, blogs, online courses and 
other material in the internet. 
It is also very easy to get started by following some of the tutorials
and making use of pre-built libraries.
However, this often leads to a false impression that one has understood
everything.  
There is no real short-cut to learning and without a deep understanding
of the various components it is very difficult to develop suitable solutions.

The best way to get a start is to learn from the masters!
In this post, I will provide some of the books and material that I think 
are good places to start the study.
This list is not exhaustive and is based on my bias towards a more Bayesian
approach. 
Although if one tries to be pragmatic, it does not make sense to give a comprehensive
list as there is no way a person can read all of them and be up to speed
in a short amount of time.
The topics covered by these books are vast and it takes repeated efforts
to master the topics. 
So get ready for the long-haul!
