<p>

I have put on various hats over the course of my career.
I am trained as a physicist and pursued research both in academia and in industry.
In general, I am interested in applying mathematical models and computer simulations to
various problems, as well as building computational work flows.

My current focus is on using data analytic methods and their applications in industry.
